Tech/framework used:

- Built in JavaScript

Features:

- Designed for use in chrome with a full screen browser
- Simple interface & controls
- Animations for card movement
- Message bar displaying status of game at all times

Summary so far:
- Game works best in full screen browser on a desktop/laptop machine.
- Can be played on smaller screens, CSS needs to be refactored to transform display responsively based on players device
